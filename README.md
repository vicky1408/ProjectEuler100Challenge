To spice things up, I have opted for node js, dotnet (core) and python to solve all the problems.

You can find the solutions for the resolved problems with steps to replicate from the specific folder listed.

You can also join the challenge with me on twitter : https://twitter.com/vigneshv01/status/1213315051257511936
